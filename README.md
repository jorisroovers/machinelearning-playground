# machinelearning-playground
Playground for machine learning stuff.
Most of this won't be useful to others; it's just me playing around with datascience and machine learning topics.

I'm currently following [https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning](), so some code relates to the
topics in that repository.

I'm using the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) since it takes away a lot of hassle
that usually comes with installing scientific python packages.

The content in the datascience directory is mostly based on the
[Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793) book.

## Getting started ##
Just run ```ipython notebook``` or ```jupyter notebook``` to start the ipython notebook server and access the notebooks.
